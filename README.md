UTLDR is an agent-based, stochastic, frameworks that can be used to simulate the effect of alternative combinations of public interventions.

UTLDR name is an acronym of the "meta-compartments" that compose it: **U**ndetected - **T**ested - **L**ockdown - **D**ead - **R**ecovered.

It requires as input a population of agents (preferibly characterized by age/gender as well as working place) tied in a social tissue (it is not a mean field approach).
Household structures as well as schools, workingplaces and other social circles are assumend to be embedded within the social network and annotated at agent level.
